In this article we provided examples of ways in which AI is being pioneered and applied in education. While the applications included are in use in some form today, one could argue that most are still in a relatively “primitive” stage in terms of envisioned long-term objectives.

Specifically, we explore:

Smart Content –  Technology that attempts to condense text books into useful tool for exam preparation such as true or false questions
Intelligent Tutoring Systems – Personalized electronic tutoring customized to the learning styles and preferences of the pupil
Virtual Facilitators and Learning Environments – Virtual human guides and facilitators for use in a variety of educational and therapeutic environments
